# Patchew Based-on Support

## Objective

Apply a pending prerequisite series named by Patchew's `Based-on` metadata
before reviewing the dependent patchset. This extends the prerequisite
support from exact b4 patch IDs to a message ID that names an entire series.

The implementation supports metadata present in the cover letter or in the
single patch body. It uses `Based-on` when no valid b4 prerequisite patch IDs
are present, without depending on the Patchew service or its database.

## Metadata

Parse b4 `prerequisite-patch-id` entries first. A nonempty list is authoritative:
preserve its declared order and do not parse or resolve `Based-on` metadata in
the same body. Stale, malformed, or conflicting `Based-on` values cannot change
the dependency set or prevent a valid b4 declaration from being used.

When no valid prerequisite patch IDs are present, parse `Based-on` instead.
Keep the existing b4 parser's handling of malformed, quoted, and indented lines;
these do not select the b4 path. Bare `prerequisite-message-id` and
`prerequisite-change-id` values remain outside the supported b4 metadata and do
not suppress `Based-on`. Exceeding the b4 patch-ID limit is an error, not a
reason to fall back to `Based-on`.

Recognize an unquoted line at the beginning of a body line with this form:

```text
Based-on: prerequisite-series-message-id@example.com
```

Optional angle brackets around the message ID are accepted. Tag names are
matched case-insensitively, duplicate values are ignored, and more than one
distinct `Based-on` value is rejected because Patchew does not define an
ordering for multiple base series. Empty values, comments on the same line,
non-ASCII or whitespace characters inside the message ID, values longer than
998 bytes, and unmatched angle brackets are rejected.

Quoted or indented lines are not active metadata. This avoids treating a
quoted discussion, prose example, or diff context as a dependency.

## Resolution

The message ID must name the head of a complete series. Resolve it in this
order:

1. Find the series in Sashiko's server-side database.
2. If no complete local copy exists, fetch the message thread from Lore's
   public-inbox mbox endpoint.
3. Locate the exact named series head and select only its descendant patch
   messages.
4. Require one patch for every part number and order them by part number.

A local hit does not depend on the prerequisite patchset reaching `Reviewed`.
Stored patch content is sufficient. Nullable stable patch IDs from databases
created before the b4 migration are calculated while resolving the series.

Lore threads may include reviews, prior discussion, or another patch series.
The resolver must never treat every patch in the returned thread as part of
the prerequisite. A named cover selects matching descendant patches. A
coverless series may be named by its first patch and selects matching patch
descendants. A later patch in a series is not a valid series head.

## Nested and Mixed Dependencies

A prerequisite series may contain its own `Based-on` metadata. Resolve these
dependencies recursively and apply the deepest series first. Detect cycles by
normalized message ID, including a dependency back to the target series, and
reject chains deeper than eight series.

Select one dependency source for each series, including the target. If it has
valid b4 patch IDs, resolve only those patches in declared order. Otherwise,
resolve its `Based-on` series recursively. Apply the selected prerequisites
before the series itself. Deduplicate the resulting patch list by stable Git
patch ID while preserving the first occurrence.

This keeps b4's exact patch list and application order authoritative instead
of adding an unrelated series or allowing `Based-on` ordering to override it.
The selected source is represented as an enum so resolution cannot combine
both formats accidentally. A failed b4 lookup is fatal; it must not cause a
fallback to `Based-on` and silently select different prerequisite content.

## Resource and Trust Boundaries

Keep the existing limit of 128 unique prerequisite patches. Share the limit of
eight remote Lore operations across message-ID thread fetches and patch-ID
searches in one resolution. Reuse the existing HTTP timeout, retry, compressed
download, decompressed mbox, message-count, and Git patch-ID subprocess limits.

Treat message IDs and downloaded email as untrusted input. Encode a message ID
as one URL path segment without allowing it to change the configured Lore
origin. Reject malformed series, duplicate part numbers, missing parts,
non-head references, dependency cycles, and limits exceeded. Any such failure
stops baseline preparation rather than reviewing against a different tree.

## Worktree Behavior

Flatten resolved dependencies into the existing `PrerequisitePatch` type and
use the existing worktree application path. Prerequisites remain preparation
context only:

- They are applied before the target patchset for every baseline candidate.
- Their final commit is the effective review baseline.
- They are excluded from the target review payload.
- They do not change the target patch-to-commit mapping.
- Lore-only fetches are not persisted or scheduled for separate review.

No schema migration is required.

## Testing

- Parser tests cover angle brackets, case, duplicate tags, ambiguous tags,
  malformed values, quoted lines, and b4 precedence over `Based-on` metadata.
- Series extraction tests cover cover letters, coverless single patches,
  unrelated patches in the same Lore thread, missing and duplicate parts, and
  non-head message IDs.
- Resolver tests cover local lookup, Lore fallback, nested dependencies,
  stable patch-ID deduplication, cycles, depth, and shared remote-operation
  limits. Mixed-metadata tests verify b4 ordering, ignored `Based-on` values,
  nested precedence, and no fallback after a failed b4 lookup.
- Reviewer tests verify that a target patch which fails on the upstream base
  applies after its selected prerequisites and still uses the prerequisite
  tip as its effective review baseline, including when both formats appear.
- Existing b4 prerequisite tests continue to protect patch-ID-only behavior.

## Out of Scope

- Reading `Based-on` tags from replies posted after the cover or patch.
- Requeueing a patchset when a later reply adds or changes dependency tags.
- Querying Patchew's API or consuming Patchew-hosted Git tags.
- Supporting multiple distinct `Based-on` values on one series.
- Persisting Lore-only prerequisite series as ordinary patchsets.
